SuperOnana is a sweeper-keeper who has strong distribution skills. He regularly comes out of his box to 
help build-up play and is known for his confidence on the ball and range of passing.
In Cameroon's opening 2022 World Cup game against Switzerland, SuperOnana had more touches of the ball 
outside of the box (26) than any goalkeeper 
in a World Cup match since records began in 1966.
 He was described as 
 resembling a "holding midfielder at times" in UEFA's Technical Observers' report 
 on The 2022â€“23 Champions League

 In May 2019, SuperOnana spoke out about being a black goalkeeper, saying they had to work harder than their white counterparts 
 due to misconceptions about them making "mistakes"
